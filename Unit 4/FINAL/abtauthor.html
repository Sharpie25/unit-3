                    <p>Zac Brown is the main singer and founder of the group. He has lead the group to win many Grammys and become a successfully impactful band and recruited all of the current members.</p>
                    <p>Though Zac Brown created the group, all of the other members are just as important. Coy Bowles plays guitar and piano, but before he was scouted out by Zac Brown he played in his own band. Clay Cook plays many intruments for the band. Jimmy De Martini plays guiatr and violin for the band. Chris Fryar throughly enjoys playing the drums for the band. John Driskell Hopkins sings and plays almost every instrument the band needs. Matt Mangano plays bass, but before the band he helped his friends record their music. Before Caroline Jones joined, she opened for the group and eventually joined in 2021.</p>
