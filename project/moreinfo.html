            <h2>Shop</h2>
            <p>Pet shops sell animals that are most likely from breeders or mills. Specifically, puppy mills are breeders that breed puppies in mass amounts just for them to be sold. Breeders and mills are legal in the US, but they are not as regualted as they should be. This creates problems with the way animals are treated when being handled or sold. Buying from pet shops supports these programs and gives money to these organizations to harm more animals.</p>

            <h2>Adopt</h2>
            <p>Adopting animals gives animals who need homes a place to feel safer than where ever their previous homes were. Most animals in shelters were either surrendered or were found outside. These animals are not traumatized and need owners to take better care of them.</p>

            <h2>Data Explination</h2>
            <p>While the percantages for buying from stores and breeders is low, the number still exists. People need to keep the shleter percentage high when adopting an animal. People are starting to move away from pet stores and breeders, but that does not mean those places do not exist and are not regulated. Please consider adopting and not shopping.</p>
